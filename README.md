#What's Infinite Ulysses?
This repo contains the code I created, modified, or otherwise built off to make [the Infinite Ulysses digital edition](http://www.infiniteulysses.com). Check out [this quick 3-minute video about the project](http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/) to learn more about the site and the resarch project behind it. This repo will eventually offer Drupal modules, site theming, documentation, and an installation profile to quickly pop up your own participatory digital edition.

Infinite Ulysses is a dissertational project of designing, building, and user-testing a "participatory digital edition" of James Joyce's difficult but unbelievably rewarding novel Ulysses—a website where you can read the novel, annotate it (highlight words in the text and add comments on them) to ask questions, provide answers and interpretations and definitions, and otherwise collaboratively explore and enrich the novel. Infinite Ulysses builds off of a ton of great FOSS (free and open-source) coding work focusing around the "Annotator.js" tool (see the Provenance for more specific credits), with a focus on packaging these into a Drupal site where existing and custom social modules can act on the annotations (ranking them, tagging them, curating them, etc.). Check out my research blog [literaturegeek.com](http://www.literaturegeek.com) for regular blogging on the project's progress, or see [this quick 3-minute video about the project](http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation).

##Milestones
- [x] Alpha-testing: Open site to committee, Ulysses Seen, friends (November-December 2014)
- [x] Beta testing I (individual volunteers; January 2015)
- [x] Beta testing II (groups, classes, book clubs; Late January 2015 throughout Spring 2015)
- [ ] Article draft providing project narrative (text and website; available by May 2015)
- [ ] Site 1.0 release on Bloomsday 2015 (June 16, 2015)
- [ ] Installation profile for easy set-up of a site with all the above implemented (Summer 2015?)
- [ ] Code/set-up documentation and thoroughly comment code for understanding by others (Summer 2015?)

#I want to use this!
You can! That is, you will be able to, easily, once the code is polished and documented (and a piece of the code provided by a colleague is made public). This is a dissertational project, and some of the work ater I've successfully defended will be packaging the code and creating user-friendly documentation so that others may make their own copy of the site (if that floats your boat) or otherwise mimic or build off this work. There will be many updates to the code over the next year (and beyond), as well as user-testing (both analysis and raw data to be made public). You may wish to check out [my page on Infinite Ulysses IP & Copyright](http://www.infiniteulysses.com/content/ip-and-copyright) to understand what you can reuse (and how).

##Documentation
This will eventually link you to resources to turn this repo into a participatory digital edition site of your own (probably over Summer 2015).

## Issues queue
You'll notice there's already a bunch of items in [this repo's issue queue](https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/issues); I'm currently keeping most of my tasks private in Basecamp, but I'll be moving any remaining tasks here after the public site release in June 2015. 

You can submit issues to tell me about bugs on the site or feature requests, or otherwise contact me about the [InfiniteUlysses.com](http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com) part of my dissertation. You might notice issues get tagged with various labels—this helps me do things like prioritize work on anything blocking use/accessibility/inclusion on the site, or keep track of good suggestions and requests that I won't have time to address during the scope of my dissertation. The "out of scope" label doesn't mean your report isn't useful—any feedback is useful! I'll just only be able to do so much while trying to finish my PhD in 2015, which means data clean-up, analysis, and drafting a scholarly article on the project as well as trying to make it a better experience for our reading community. You can check out [this page on the scope of my project](https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/blob/master/About%20the%20Dissertation/SCOPE.md) to understand what I'll be working on beforemy dissertation defense.

# Caveat emptor: in-progress code
This is the public repo for code related to the Infinite Ulysses participatory digital edition, the focus of Amanda Visconti's (@amandavisconti) digital humanities doctoral dissertation. Watch a quick 3-minute video or read more about Infinite Ulysses [here](http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/) or [sign up to beta-test the site](http://goo.gl/qtcy6).

**WARNING** This repo represents code that is likely to be in-progress, outdated, insecure, strange, silly, or otherwise unwieldy, in an attempt to share the entire building process with the public. I don't currently recommend using any of it, and I cannot currently provide assistance with using any of this code. Please wait for Summer 2015, when I'll provide friendly documentation on creating your own participatory digital edition and also abstract the code from Infinite Ulysses to be used with any text.

If you'd like to be notified when an easy-to-use code+documentation package is available, please [use the sign up form here](http://www.infiniteulysses.com/#signup) and indicate your interest in the comments.
