An ongoing manifest of the work my dissertation comprises, with explanations of the what and why behind formats unusual in literary studies. (Happy to take feedback if something isn't explained clearly enough, via [@Literature_Geek](http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek) or [my contact form](http://www.infiniteulysses.com/contact).)

# Thoughts:
+ Creating design wireframes, writing, code, and other web development activities are **both similar and different** to chapter-writing in terms of quantifying output:

  + Like chapter-writing drafts, with code **there's a lot of work that doesn't make it into the final product**. In my case, the final product doesn't include things like example Drupal modules I built to learn things like how to make the Annotator tool communicate with the Drupal database. 

  + **Better code is quite often more concise code** (i.e. less lines of code). This may or may not be the case with chapter-writing; in cases where you're shooting for a chapter length in some word count range (e.g. 20 pages), improving your writing is more likely to not impact the overall word count.

##Research writing
**Item:** LiteratureGeek.com blog posts

**What it does (technical, research):** A research blog with 31 posts (average length: 2,000-3,000 words) plus crosspostings to HASTAC.org plus 2 unique blog posts at mith.umd.edu. Posts are moderately polished; think somewhere between first and final draft level of writing: academic blogging is fast but careful about reaching its scholarly audience.

**Where to find it:** http://www.literaturegeek.com/category/dissertation/; http://www.hastac.org/blogs/amanda-visconti; http://mith.umd.edu/invitation-beta-test-infinite-ulysses-digital-edition/ and http://mith.umd.edu/infinite-ulysses-designing-public-humanities-conversation/

------
**Item:** Values statement

**What it does (technical, research):** Written statement of scholarly values as they apply to the dissertation.

**Where to find it:** http://www.literaturegeek.com/values/

------
**Item:** Book proposal on the digital dissertation process with University of Michigan Press [Practices in the Digital Humanities series](http://www.digitalculture.org/books/book-series/practices-in-the-digital-humanities)

**What it does (technical, research):** With co-author Dr. Kathie Gossett, book proposal, book outline, and example chapter thinking through the digital dissertation process from designing your format to fit your research questions through the defense.

**Where to find it:** More info once proposal accepted.

##Talks and Presentations
**Item:** 4 invited talks about the dissertation:
* June 2013: Presentation to Dr. Hans Gabler's Digital Ulysses Master Class at the University of Victoria

* April 2014: [2nd Annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu/news-events/nebraskaforum)

* March 2015: [Not-yet-named panel on digital dissertations at CUNY Graduate Center](http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-dissertations/)

* April 2015: [MITH Digital Dialogue](http://mith.umd.edu/digitaldialogues))

**What it does (technical, research):** Written preparation for talks aimed at various audiences (Joycean, digital humanities scholars, digital dissertation students and advisors, digital humanities/public)

------
**Item:** 3 service panel talks supporting UMD English graduate students

**What it does (technical, research):** Synthesis of dissertational experience and writing of presentation notes for three panels: "What Does a 21st Century Dissertation Look Like?", "Social Media for Humanities Researchers", "Preparing for Your Ph.D. Exams"

------
**Item:** Introduction to the Infinite Ulysses Project video

**What it does (technical, research):** A three-minute overview of my research project aimed at a public audience. Condenses my research questions and translates their exigence for the public. Combines spoken text and still images.

##Miscellaneous
**Item**: This manifest document

**What it does (technical, research):** This manifest took considerable time to create (roughly three work days); tasks included tracking down files I've altered since beginning the dissertation, figuring out how to quantify codework, and translating technical jargon to explanations free from technical vocabulary.

------
**Item:** 3 fellowship/scholarships in support of the project received (MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellowship 2014-2015, Editing Modernism in Canada Ph.D. Fellowship 2013-2014, UMD English Summer Fellowship 2014)

**What it does (technical, research):** I count scholarships/fellowships as produced items because of the significant effort in writing the proposals that led to them (although I didn't count non-successful applications).
