# The Manifest
An ongoing, currently incomplete manifest of artifacts that comprise my dissertation.
+ ? unique research blog posts (not counting crossposted blog posts such as those at HASTAC)
+ ? of those blog posts were highlighted by Digital Humanities Now (x as editor's choice, y as resource posts)
+ ? websites (Drupal digital edition, umbrella site)
+ ? scholarly articles
+ ? datasets released for public use
+ annotations (and comments on annotations) authored on InfiniteUlysses.com
+ site pages authored (e.g. research data plan, user rights)
+ ? lines of Javascript or jQuery
+ ? lines of PHP
+ ? lines of HTML and CSS/LESS
+ ? CMS installations
+ ? themes
+ ? key stages of book page design
+ ? Google Analytic custom reports (gathering and analyzing data from user visits to the digital edition)
+ ? beta-testers (first round, committee, second round)
+ ? interview/surveys (y completed and return; z follow-up)
+ ? modules installed on digital edition CMS (requiring search, reading documentation and code, testing and configuring on deveopment server)
+ + ? of those modules had code changed by me
+ ? corrections to the Modernist Versions Project digital transcription of the first Ulysses printing
+ ? other changes to the transcription (adding formatting such as indents and centering, and typographical choices such as italicization and all-caps) resulting in
+ 1 digital text file suitable for dropping into a Drupal site or really any HTML page to display Ulysses with correct typography
+ 1 accepted commit to another DH GitHub repo (currently in [a private repo](https://github.com/LacunaStories/Drupal-Master/commit/a2b3d1c317625e7427de11b549a8b6e653442af3))
+ 1 accepted patch to a Drupal module (Annotation; [patch issue here](https://www.drupal.org/node/2329271))
+ 4 invited talks (June 2013: Digital Ulysses Master Class with Dr. Hans Gabler; April 2014: [2nd Annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu/news-events/nebraskaforum); March 2015: [not-yet-named panel on digital dissertations at CUNY Graduate Center](http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-dissertations/); Spring 2015: [MITH Digital Dialogue](http://mith.umd.edu/digitaldialogues))
+ 3 service panel talks supporting UMD English graduate students (What Does a 21st Century Dissertation Look Like, Social Media for Humanities Researchers, Preparing for Your Ph.D. Exams)
+ 3 fellowship/scholarships in support of the project received (MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellowship 2014-2015, Editing Modernism in Canada Ph.D. Fellowship 2013-2014, UMD English Summer Fellowship 2014)
+ 1 book proposal (more info when acccepted)

# Thoughts:
+ I'm treating code like chapter-writing in that there's a lot of writing work that doesn't make it into the final product, but is essential to getting the work functioning. I don't think I have a great way of tracking an equivalent of how many total words I wrote (I can get an approximation from infrequent early git commits, perhaps).
+ A MITH staffer pointed out that there isn't a perfect correlation between chapter drafting and draft code, since final code (if it's good) is much more likely to be shorter. So, I'll probably inlcude line items for code/etc. produced during/as part of the dissertation that may not be part of the final product.
+ I count scholarships/fellowships as produced items because of the significant written proposals that led to them (although I didn't count non-successful applications)
+ Using "lines of code" as a measure is a bit weird, but I can't think of a better measurement unit.
